# Nextbike Rental Prediction
This repository contains code of a semester project from the course Analytics and Applications. The aim was to find suitable patterns in the data to gain insights in the dynamics of NextBike rental behaviour. This was to find and create suitable features to apply the learned methods of the course. Due to the high volatility and various influencing factors predicting the number of rentals was challenging but the results of the extensive analysis were promising. 

The jupyter notebook can be found [HERE](Advanced_Analytics_submission.ipynb) for reproducability. The notebook featuring the full output can be viewed when downloading the repo as a ZIP and opening Advanced_Analytics_HTML.html on your local machine.
